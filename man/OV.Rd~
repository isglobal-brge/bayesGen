\title{
CNV data for Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data portal
}

\usage{data(OV)}

\format{
Two data frames (cnvs and phenotype) containing copy number data and phenotype information for 456 individuals diagnosed with Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma, respectively. 
}

\details{
The list of known copy number variations (CNVs) is downloaded from the Database of Genomic Variants.


The copy number data matrix corresponds to the number of copies for each copy number variations (CNVs) downloaded from the Database of Genomic Variants using the genome build GRCh37 (http://projects.tcag.ca/variation/downloads/variation.hg19.v10.nov.2010.txt). 

The phenotype data.frame contains information about the tumor residual disease after receiving treatment (variable coded as 'tumor_residual_disease' at TCGA data portal). Initial TCGA data included 572 females, however 116 of them did not have information about this covariate and, hence, were removed for this analysis. Variable had 4 categories: 'Complete remission', 'Partial remission', 'Stable disease' and 'Progressive disease'. Categories 'Stable disease' and 'Progressive disease' were collapsed into one categorie ('Null response').
